This project is to provide an easy way to build web application with Eiffel

= Get the source code =
See https://github.com/EiffelSoftware/EiffelWebReloaded/wiki/Getting-started

 git clone http://github.com/EiffelSoftware/EiffelWebReloaded.git

= Goals =
Provide a framework to easily build web application with Eiffel, with the following requirements
portable web server framework: this means, platform independant, and web server independant solution, and even protocol independant (support for fcgi, cgi, ...)
up-to-date with Eiffel: standard syntax, and void-safety by default
framework to help the user to build quickly a web application (RESTful service, CMS web interface, XML-RPC ...)
